* What to do
  To use these configurations properly it is important to leave all the files in
  the folder that holds the git repository. In order to use the files elsewhere
  you must create symbolic links.
  
  #+begin_src bash
      $ ln -s {target_file} {symbolic_file}
  #+end_src
  #+begin_example
      $ ln -s {target_file} {symbolic_file}
  #+end_example
  
* Where should the symbolic links go
  Some of the files need to be placed in specific folders in order to work properly.

** org-templates
   This folder must be in the =~/.emacs.d/=

   #+begin_src bash
       $ ln -s ~/.emacs.d/org-templates ~/src/customized-org/org-templates
   #+end_src

* How to find and rename symbolic links
  This is the code to find a file by it's symbolic link.

  #+begin_src bash
      $ find / -lname ~/src/customized-org/{symbolic_link} 2>/dev/null
  #+end_src
